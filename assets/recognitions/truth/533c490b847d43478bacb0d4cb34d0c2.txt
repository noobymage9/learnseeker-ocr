Peter and Hamid were neighbours. Although Hamid was a year older, they got on like
a house on fire. They sought each otherâ€™s opinions before buying a new toy or book they
both liked. Peter had toy trains while Hamid had toy cars. Peter had things lke jigsaw
puzzles and Hamid had games like Scrabble. In this way, when they shared their loys, their
combined collection became very big.
