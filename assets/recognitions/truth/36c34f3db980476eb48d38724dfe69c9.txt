As we stepped back into the house, Gabi pulled me towards her collection and
pointed oul a heart-shaped locket. It was labelled "My Favourite”. She chirped, “I had
a difficult time in schoo! that day then I found it on the feeder. It realy lifted my spirits. I'd
also like to think that it's their way of saying ‘thank you!'."
