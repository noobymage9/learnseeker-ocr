The Netherlands is famous for tulips, clogs and windmills. Amsterdam's centre
used to be cluttered with windmills fulfilling various purposes, from preventing the city
from flooding to grinding the seeds for the Dutch favourite condiment, mustard. Most
of the capital's windmills have long been dismantled but eight remain. As it turns out,
windmills have been on the move and many of Amsterdam's mills have been
relocated to the suburbs where wind conditions are more favourable than in the built-
up inner city
