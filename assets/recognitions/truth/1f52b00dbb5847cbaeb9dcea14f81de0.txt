David Wiliams spent most summers in the mountains with his son, Charlie. Both
were passionate about nature. One fateful day in 2015, around noon, on a mountain at the
Bighorn Crags, Mr Williams and Charlie were about 250 metres above ground level. Charlie
stood on a narrow ledge which was a few metres to the right of his father. Safely lashed to a
tree, he fed rope to his father. On his way up, Mr Wiliams accidentally moved a massive
boulder. Suddenly, It sailed through the air alongside Mr Willams and hit him. He barely
had time to scream before everything went black. When Charlie noticed that the massive
boulder had hit Mr Williams, he pulled on the rope. An instant later, an automatic braking
device arrested the fall. "Dad!" Charlie called. "Are you okay?"
