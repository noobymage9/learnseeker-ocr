Hamid learnt from Peter how to use the bow and arrow. He was not as good as Peter
as he had less practice. One day, Peter came down with measles and had to stay at home
for a fow days to recuperate. He polished the golden tips of the arrows until they shone.
Then, he lent the bow and arrows to Hamid who had a good time practising with them.
