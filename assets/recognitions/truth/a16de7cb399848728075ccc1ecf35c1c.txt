The second Saturday in May is National Mill Day in Holland. On that day,
owners of about 950 windmills and watermills open their doors exuberantly to visitors
as these historical buildings become hubs of activity once again. If you venture just a
little outside of Amsterdam, you can admire your fair share of windmills in the outdoor
museum, Zaanse Schans. it pays homage to the Dutch heritage. In a tand that used
to be dotted with 10,000 windmills, those are an essential part of it.
