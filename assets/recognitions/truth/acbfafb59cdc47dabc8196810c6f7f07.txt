Unfortunately, Hamid accidentally broke the bow. The next moming, he returned the
damaged bow and apologised to Peter profusely. Unfortunately, they fell on doaf ears. Peter
stared al the bow speechlessly for a moment. When he found his voice, he started shouting
at Hamid. He accused Hamid of breaking the bow deliberately. Hamid was offended but kept
on apologising. Peter forgot the good times he had had with Hamid and the number of times
he had borrowed or used Hamid's toys.
