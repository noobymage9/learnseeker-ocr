Charlie's destination was the trailhead, 19 kilometres away, whore a couple of
volunteers lived in a cabin equipped with a two-way radio. Charlie hoped they would use
the radio to call for help. He had to take a long time to get there. Grizzly bears and
mountain lions frequent the surrounding woods. As he walked, Charlie blew his emergency
whistle to ward them off and he thought it would bring him the help that he needed.
Following Mr Williams' instructions, Charlie took the detour, calling out to anyone who might
be camped there. After a few hundred metres, he stopped to calculate the odds. it was a
weekday when there were few visitors. If he continued and encountered no one, he would
have wasted an hour.
