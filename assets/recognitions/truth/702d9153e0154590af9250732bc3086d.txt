To kick off the 3-month long campaign, Midiand Mall staff and their
families will participate in the inaugural Midland Walkathon, flagging
off at 6 a.m. on 1 October 2018. Midiand Mall Loyalty Club members
were invited to join in and about 700 of them have signed up for the
5-kilometre walk that wil start at Midland Mall, take participants
around the beautful Midland Park, and end back at Midland Mall.
Participants can enjoy a leisurely walk along the scenic route and be
treated to healthy wraps and smoothies for breakfast after the walk,
courtesy of the event's generous sponsor, Hearty Wraps.
