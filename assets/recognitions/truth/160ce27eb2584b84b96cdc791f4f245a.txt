Peterâ€™s mother talked to him about his foolishness. Pater saw where he had gone
wrong. He agreed to apologise to Hamid and would do his best to win his good friend back.
To make up for his foolishness, Peter lent Hamid his new soccer ball for him to play with his
friends in school. Hamid was very touched by this gesture.
