I made Doug take the oath, promising not to tell anyone what we were going to do
afier lunch. If he broke the oath, his teeth and hair would fall out. I found an old peanut-
Dutter jar and poked a few holes in tha lid. We did not want any spiders dying before they
got a chance Io fight the red ants. We chose a two-foot stick for catching the spiders,
and then we hed our gear behind the garage.
