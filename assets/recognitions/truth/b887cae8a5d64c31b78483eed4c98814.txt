It was a cold morning on 11 June 2017. My mother was so touched to witness.
the birth of 5 new born kittens in the cottage. She probably felt victorious as she had
managed to help Tina, our Persian cat, prepare for her delivery. Over the next few days,
I placed taking care of the kittens above play time.

In the evenings, my parents and I would take all the kittens on leash to the park.
Slowly, my kittens became well-liked and many people loved to take pictures with them.

My mother had made up her mind to keep the kittens for as long as we could.
She would make it a point to vacuum and mop the cottage daily.
