Guang is one of the many children who peddles souvenirs, such
as fridge magnets and postcards, to tourists at the Great Wall. It is not
uncommon for the children to have picked up a few key phrases of the
languages of the most frequent visitor - from India, Korea and Europe.
However, Guang has stepped up his game. He surprises the vistors with his
abilities to converse in many foreign tongues.
