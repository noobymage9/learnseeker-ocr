Peter's favourite toy was his set of bow and arrows. His uncle who lived overseas had
bought the set for him. The arrows had golden lips that shone In tho sun. His uncle had
taught him how to use the bow and arrows when he visited Peter last year. Peter practised
hard and became very good at it. He could hit the bull's-eye most of the time. He was proud
of his precision and skill. He treasured his bow and arrows and kept them properly so that
they would not be damaged or broken.
