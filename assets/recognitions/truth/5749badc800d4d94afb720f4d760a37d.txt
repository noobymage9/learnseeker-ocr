I had a light-hearted dialogue with Gabi and found out that her relationship with the
neighbourhood crows had begun accidentally. She recounted how as a four-year-old,
she was prone to having food remnants tumble off her lap whenever she alighted from
the car. One day, a crow rushed in to rocover them. Amused, she even threw her
unfinished food at the crow. This attracted more crows. Soon, crows were spotted
watching Gabi closely.
