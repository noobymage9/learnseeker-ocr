13-year-old Charlie Williams knew that he was the only one who could get help. He
got ready for a long hike. He stowed a water botte and some snacks in his day pack, along
with a sleeping bag, in case he had to set up camp. He left another water bottie for his
father, filled the cooking pot to the brim with water from the creek and also set out a week's
supply of energy bars. Then, he took a map with the location of the campsite.
